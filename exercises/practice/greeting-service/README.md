# Greeting Service

In this exercise, you will build a simple service that is exposed over HTTP and it accepts HTTP POST request and send back a greeting message to the consumer by appending the payload of the request to the greeting message.


The objectives are:

- Write an HTTP service that accepts only POST requests on a specific path (e.g. '/greeting')
- Extract payload content and append it with the content of the greeting message.
